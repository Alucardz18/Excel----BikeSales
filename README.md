# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Analysis (Excel Dashboard Project)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores customer purchasing behavior for bike sales using an interactive Excel dashboard. The analysis focuses on how demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors influence whether a customer purchases a bike.

The dashboard was built using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers to allow dynamic filtering and visual exploration of the dataset.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains 1,000 customer entries with the following fields:

Gender – Male or Female

Income – Annual salary

Marital Status – Married or Single

Age Bracket – Adolescent, Middle Age, Old

Region – Europe, North America, Pacific

Education – High School to Graduate Degree

Occupation – Clerical, Professional, Manual, etc.

Commute Distance – 0–1 miles, 1–2 miles, 2–5 miles, etc.

Number of Children – Count of dependents

Home Ownership – Yes/No

Car Ownership – Yes/No

Purchased Bike – Yes/No

The dataset was provided with the project and cleaned within Excel for analysis.

## 📊 Dashboard & Analysis

The Excel dashboard visualizes purchasing patterns across multiple dimensions:

Average Income per Purchase

Compares average income of bike buyers vs non-buyers

Broken down by gender

Age Bracket Count by Purchase

Shows which age groups purchase bikes more frequently

Commute Distance Count by Purchase

Examines how commute length correlates with bike buying

Home Ownership & Car Ownership

Two pie charts showing buyer vs non-buyer distribution

Helps determine whether ownership impacts likelihood to purchase

Impact of Children on Purchasing
